# api

Place any custom api's here - you can extend existing apis or write your own. For detailed instructions and examples, see:

https://github.com/jsguy/misojs/wiki/Api

NOTE: You must create a directory in /modules/api/[APINAME], and then name your file [APINAME].api.js for it to work.

Eg:

Directory: /modules/api/instagram
API file:  /modules/api/instagram/instagram.api.js
